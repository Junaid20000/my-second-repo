    <h1>CSS for Biginer</h1>

    <strong>Style Tag. Font. Height Width</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      (CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: Inline - by using the style
      attribute inside HTML elements Internal - by using a
      <b> style></b> element in the head section External - by using a
      <b>link</b> element to link to an external CSS file The most common way to
      add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this
      tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to
      demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. )
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong class="jh">Class</strong>
    <h3>
      We can apply a class to various elements so that it could be numerous
      times on a single page. <br />
      The class is assigned to an element and its name starts with "." followed
      by the name of the class. <br />We can attach multiple class selectors to
      an element. <br />
      If there is maltiple classes then use <b id="jh"> Space _ </b>
    </h3>

    <b class="jh">ID</b>
    <h3 class="ohh">
      <li>
        The Id is unique in a page, and we can only apply it to one specific
        element.
      </li>
      <li>
        The name of the Id starts with the "#" symbol followed by a unique id
        name.
      </li>
      <li>We can attach only one ID selector to an element.</li>
    </h3>

    <h1>Span Tag</h1>
    <p id="as">
      The span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or
      a part of a document. The span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated
      with JavaScript using the <span>class</span> or id attribute. The span>
      tag is much like the div> element, but div> is a block-level element and
      span> is an inline element.
    </p>

    <h1>
      DIV Tag
      <p class="jh">
        The DIV tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The DIV
        tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with
        CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The DIV tag is easily styled by
        using the class or id attribute. Any sort of content can be put inside
        the DIV tag! Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before
        and after the DIV element.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h1>Inline.Block.Inline-Block</h1>
      <p id="pk">
        <em style="color: red; font-size: 40px; background-color: aquamarine">
          Inline</em
        ><br />
        Displays an element as an inline element. Any height and width
        properties will have no effect. The display property specifics the
        display behavior of an element. It‚Äôs a must know for controlling the
        layout of an element. There‚Äôs a bunch of property values. But let‚Äôs
        start off with the essential inline. This one displays the element
        inline or on the same line. In other words, inline elements do NOT start
        on a new line and only takes up as much width as its content. So, if you
        try to set any width and height, it will have NO effects.<br />

        .inline-element {<br />
        display: inline;<br />
        width: 1000px; /* ‚ùå won't have any effect */<br />
        height: 1000px; /* ‚ùå won't have any effect */<br />
        } <br />
        #inline elements<br />
        Here are a few elements that have a default inline property: <br />

        span<br />
        a<br />
        img<br />
        And most of the formatting tags are also are inherently inline:<br />

        em<br />
        strong<br />
        i<br />
        small
      </p>

      <p id="ck">
        <em style="color: red; font-size: 40px; background-color: aquamarine">
          Inline-Block</em
        ><br />
        Displays an element as an inline-level block container. You CAN set
        height and width values.<br />

        Alright, let's move on to inline-block. It‚Äôs essentially the same thing
        as inline, except that you can set height and width values.<br />

        .inline-block-element { <br />
        display: inline-block;<br />
        width: 1000px; /* ‚úÖ yes, it will work */<br />
        height: 1000px; /* ‚úÖ yes, it will work */<br />
        }<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <em style="color: red; font-size: 40px; background-color: aquamarine">
          Block</em
        ><br />
        <br />
        So far, we talked about inline. Now let's switched to the opposite of
        it, block. Remember inline elements appears on the same line. Well,
        block starts on a NEW line and takes up the full width available. So
        that means block elements will occupy the entire width of its parent
        element. #block elements<br />
        Here are a few elements that have a default block property:<br />
        <br />
        div<br />
        h1<br />
        p<br />
        li<br />
        section<br />
        <br />
        <em style="color: red; font-size: 40px; background-color: aquamarine">
          #Explained in non-dev terms</em
        ><br />
        Imagine if you're attending a concert, you have rows of seats, right. If
        you assign your friend with an inline seat, they will sit next to you.
        So the thing with inline seats, it's that they all are the same physical
        chair.You can't manipulate the chair to make it larger or smaller. One
        size fits all they call it!<br />
        <br />
        Now your friend Jennifer wants to join you, but because she is the
        daughter of the owner of the stadium. She gets assigned an inline-block
        seat. Well, she still gets to sit next to you. Cause she's "inline" with
        you (bad pun, lol üòÇ) and of course you want her to sit next to you.
        However, because she is the daughter of the stadium, her mom wants to
        make sure she's comfortable. So she gives her a special seat, where her
        chair is customized and can be adjusted to make it bigger or smaller.
        Nepotism at its finest ü§´<br />
        <br />
        Your classmate Angelina is also attending the concert. Now your friend
        Jennifer doesn't really like her. So she tells her mom to assign her a
        block seat. That way Angelina is not seated next to you. Instead she
        sits in the next row.<br />
        <br />
        #Final Solution<br />
        inline The element doesn‚Äôt start on a new line and only occupy just the
        width it requires. You can‚Äôt set the width or height.<br />
        <br />
        inline-block It‚Äôs formatted just like the inline element, where it
        doesn‚Äôt start on a new line. BUT, you can set width and height
        values.<br />
        <br />
        block The element will start on a new line and occupy the full width
        available. And you can set width and height values.
